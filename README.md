# Coin-Toss-Randomness
This project is about identifying the fake coin toss from real one. We will see how human brain misinterpret randomness.

There is dataset of two coin tosses A and B for 200 times each. Out of these two coins, only one is real coin toss data, obtained by flipping a real coin 200 times. And the other is fake one ( generated 200 times randomly by my human friend ). This data was generated to experiment the human perception of randomness.

1 -> denotes 'Head' 0 -> denotes 'Tail'

As a data scientist, your goal is determine which of the coin tosses A or B, is probably Fake / Real .
